<a name="fire-eaters"></a><h3>I</h3>
<h3>THE FIRE-EATERS</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/008.png" alt="A" class=
"firstletter" />long time ago there lived a man who had the
biggest head in the world. Into it he had crammed all the
knowledge that might be gathered from the four corners of the
earth. Every one said he was the wisest man living. "If I could
only find a wife," said the sage, "as wise for a woman as I am
for a man, what a race of head-pieces we could bring into the
world!"</p>
<p>He waited many years before any such mate could be found for
him: yet, at last, <span class="pagenum">[pg 4]</span> found she
was&mdash;one into whose head was bestowed all the wisdom that
might be gathered from the four quarters of heaven.</p>
<p>They were both old, but kings came from all sides to their
wedding, and offered themselves as god-parents to the first-born
of the new race that was to be. But, to the grief of his parents,
the child, when he arrived, proved to be a simpleton; and no
second child ever came to repair the mistake of the first.</p>
<p>That he was a simpleton was evident; his head was small and
his limbs were large, and he could run long before he could talk
or do arithmetic. In the bitterness of their hearts his father
and mother named him Noodle, without the aid of any royal
god-parents; and from that moment, for any care they took in his
bringing-up, they washed their wise hands of him.</p>
<p>Noodle grew and prospered, and enjoyed <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 5]</span> life in his own foolish way. When his
father and mother died within a short time of each other, they
left him alone without any friend in the world.</p>
<p>For a good while Noodle lived on just what he could find in
the house, in a hand-to-mouth sort of way, till at last only the
furniture and the four bare walls were left to him.</p>
<p>One cold winter's night he sat brooding over the fire,
wondering where he should get food for the morrow, when he heard
feet coming up to the door, and a knock striking low down upon
the panel. Outside there was a faint chirping and crackling
sound, and a whispering as of fire licking against the woodwork
without.</p>
<p>He opened the door and peered forth into the night. There,
just before him, stood seven little men huddled up together;
three feet high they were, with bright yellow faces all
shrivelled and sharp, and eyes <span class="pagenum">[pg 6]</span> whose light leaped and sank like candle flame before a
gust.</p>
<p>When they saw him, they shut their eyes and opened famished
mouths at him, pointing inwards with flickering finger-tips, and
shivering from head to foot with cold, although it seemed to the
youth as if the warmth of a slow fire came from them. 'Alas!'
said Noodle, in reply to these signs of hunger, 'I have not left
even a crust of bread in the house to give you! But at least come
in and make yourselves warm!' He touched the foremost, making
signs for them all to enter. 'Ah,' he cried, 'what is this, and
what are you, that the mere touch of you burns my finger?'</p>
<p>Without answer they huddled tremblingly across the threshold;
but so soon as they saw the fire burning on the hearth, they
yelped all together like a pack of hounds, and, throwing
themselves face forwards into the hot embers, began ravenously
<span class="pagenum">[pg 7]</span> to lap up the flames. They
lapped and lapped, and the more they lapped the more the fire
sank away and died. Then with their flickering finger-tips they
stirred the hot logs and coals, burrowing after the thin tapes
and swirls of vanishing flame, and fetching them out like small
blue eels still wriggling for escape.</p>
<p>After each blue wisp had been gulped down, they sipped and
sucked at their fingers for any least tricklet of flavour that
might be left; and at the last seemed more famished than when
they began.</p>
<p>'More, more, O wise Noodle, give us more!' they cried; and
Noodle threw the last of his fuel on the embers.</p>
<p>They breathed round it, fanning it into a great blaze that
leaped and danced up to the rafters; then they fell on, till not
a fleck or a flake of it was left. Noodle, seeing them still
famished, broke up a stool and threw that on the hearth. And
again <span class="pagenum">[pg 8]</span> they flared it with
their breath and gobbled off the flame. When the stool was
finished he threw in the table, then the dresser, and after that
the oak-chest and the window-seat.</p>
<p>Still they feasted and were not fed. Noodle fetched an axe,
and broke down the door; then he wrenched up the boards from the
floor, and pulled the beams and rafters out of the ceiling; yet,
even so, his guests were not to be satisfied.</p>
<p>'I have nothing left,' he said, 'but the house itself; but
since you are still hungry you shall be welcome to it!'</p>
<p>He scattered the fire that remained upon the hearth, and threw
it out and about the room; and as he ran forth to escape, up
against all the walls and right through the roof rose a great
crackling sheaf of flame. In the midst of the fire, Noodle could
see his seven guests lying along on their bellies, slopping their
hands in the heat, <span class="pagenum">[pg 9]</span> and
lapping up the flames with their tongues. 'Surely,' he thought,
'I have given them enough to eat at last!'</p>
<p>After a while all the fire was eaten away, and only the black
and smouldering ruins were left. Day came coldly to light, and
there sat Noodle, without a home in the world, watching with
considerate eye his seven guests finishing their inordinate
repast.</p>
<p>They all rose to their feet together, and came towards him
bowing; as they approached he felt the heat of their bodies as it
had been seven furnaces.</p>
<p>'Enough, O wise Noodle!' said they, 'we have had enough!'
'That,' answered Noodle, 'is the least thing left me to wonder
at. Go your ways in peace; but first tell me, who are you?' They
replied, 'We are the Fire-eaters: far from our own land, and
strangers, you have done us this service; what, now, can we
<span class="pagenum">[pg 10]</span> do to serve you?' 'Put me in
the way of a living,' said Noodle, 'and you will do me the
greatest service of all.'</p>
<p>Then the one of them who seemed to be chief took from his
finger a ring having for its centre a great firestone, and threw
it into the snow, saying, 'Wait for three hours till the ring
shall have had time to cool, then take it, and wear it; and
whatever fortune you deserve it shall bring you. For this ring is
the sweetener of everything that it touches: bread it turns into
rich meats, water into strong wine, grief into virtue, and labour
into strength. Also, if you ever need our help, you have but to
brandish the ring, and the gleam of it will reach us, and we will
be with you wherever you may be.'</p>
<p>With that they bowed their top-knots to the ground and
departed, inverting themselves swiftly till only the shining
print of seven pairs of feet remained, red-hot, over the place
where they had been standing.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 11]</span>
<p>Noodle waited for three hours; then he took up the firestone
ring, and putting it on his finger set out into the world.</p>
<p>At the first door he came to, he begged a crust of bread, and
touching it with the ring found it tasted like rich meats, well
cooked and delicately flavoured. Also, the water which he drew in
the hollow of his hand from a brook by the roadside tasted to him
like strong wine.</p>

<h3>THE GALLOPING PLOUGH</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/018.png" alt="N" class=
"firstletter" />oodle went on many miles till he came near to a
rich man's farm. Though it was the middle of winter, all the
fields showed crops of corn in progress; here it was in thin
blade, and here green, but in full ear; and here it was ripe and
ready for harvest. 'How is this,' he said to the first man he
met, 'that you have corn here in the middle of winter?' 'Ah!'
said the man, 'you have not heard of the Galloping Plough; you
too have to fall under bondage to my master.' 'What is your
master?' inquired Noodle, 'and in what bondage does he bind
man?'</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 14]</span>
<p>'My master, and your master that shall soon be,' answered the
old man, 'is the owner of all this land and the farmer of it. He
is rich and sleek and fat like his own furrows, for he has the
Galloping Plough as his possession. Ah, that! 't is a very
miracle, a wonder, a thing to catch at the heartstrings of all
beholders; it shines like a moonbeam, and is better than an Arab
mare for swiftness; it warms the very ground that it enters, so
that seeds take root and spring, though it be the middle of
winter. No man sees it but what he loses his heart to it, and
sells his freedom for the possession of it. All here are men like
myself who have become slaves because of that desire. You also,
when you see it, will become slave to it.'</p>
<p>Noodle went on through the summer and the spring corn, till he
came to bare fields. Ahead of him on a hill-top he saw the farmer
himself, sleek and rosy, and of <span class="pagenum">[pg 15]</span> full paunch, lolling like a lord at his ease; yet with
a working eye in the midst of his leisure.</p>
<p>To and fro, up to him and back, shot a silver gleam over the
purple brown of the fields; and Noodle's heart gave a thump at
the sight, for the spell of the Galloping Plough was on him.</p>
<p>Now and then he heard a clear sound that startled him with its
note. It was like the sweet whistling cry of a bird many times
multiplied. Ever when the silver gleam of the Plough had run its
farthest from the farmer, the cry sounded; and at the sound the
gleam wavered and stayed and flew back dartingly to the farmer's
side. So Noodle understood how this was the farmer's signal for
the Plough to return; and the Plough knew it as a horse its
master's voice, and came so fast that the wind whistled against
its silver side.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 16]</span>
<p>As he watched, Noodle's heart went down into the valley and up
the hillside, following in the track of the Galloping Plough. 'I
can never be happy again,' thought he; 'either I must possess it,
or must die.'</p>
<p>He came to the farmer where he sat calling his Plough to him
and letting it go; and the farmer smiled, the wide indulgent
smile of a man who knows that a bargain is about to fall his
way.</p>
<p>'What is the price,' asked Noodle, 'of yonder Galloping
Plough, that runs like an Arab mare, and returns to you at your
call?'</p>
<p>Said the farmer, 'A year's service; and if the Plough will
follow you, it is yours; if not, then you must be my bondman
until you die!'</p>
<p>Noodle looked once the way of the Galloping Plough, and his
heart flapped at his side like a sail which the wind drops
<span class="pagenum">[pg 17]</span> and lets go; and he had no
thought or will left in him but to be where the Galloping Plough
was. So he closed hands on the bargain, to be the farmer's
servant either for a year, or for his whole life.</p>
<p>For a year he worked upon the farm, and all the while plotted
how he might win the Galloping Plough to himself. The farmer kept
no watch upon it, nor put it under lock and key, for the Plough
recognised no voice but his own, nor went nor came save at his
bidding. In the night Noodle would go down to the shed or field
where it lay, and whistle to it, trying to put forth notes of the
same magical power as those which came through the farmer's
lips.</p>
<p>But no sound that came from his lips ever stroked life into
its silver sides. The year was nearly run out, and Noodle was in
despair.</p>
<p>Then he remembered the firestone ring, <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 18]</span> the Sweetener. 'May be,' said he, 'since
it changes to sweetness whatever I eat and drink, it will sweeten
my voice also, so that the Plough will obey.' So he put the ring
between his lips and whistled; and at the sound his heart turned
a somersault for joy, for he felt that out of his mouth the
farmer's magic had been over-topped and conquered.</p>
<p>The Galloping Plough stirred faintly from the furrow where it
lay, breaking the ground and marring its smooth course. Then it
shook its head slowly, and returned impassively to rest.</p>
<p>In the morning the farmer came and saw the broken earth close
under the Plough's nose. Noodle, hiding among the corn hard by,
heard him say, 'What hast thou heard in the night, O my moonbeam,
my miracle, that thy lily-foot has trodden up the ground? Hast
thou forgotten whose hand feeds thee, whose corn <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 19]</span> it is thou lovest, whose heart's care
also cherishes thee?'</p>
<p>The farmer went away, and presently came back bearing a bowl
of corn; and Noodle saw the Plough lift its head to its master's
palm, and feed like a horse on the grain.</p>
<p>Then Noodle, gay of heart, waited till it was night, and
surely his time was short, for on the morrow his wages were to be
paid, and the Plough was to be his, or else he was to be the
farmer's bondservant for the rest of his life. He took with him
three handfuls of corn, and went down to where the Plough stood
waiting by the furrow. Shaping his lips to the ring, he whistled
gently like a lover, and immediately the Plough stirred, and
lifted up its head as if to look at him.</p>
<p>'O my moonbeam, my miracle,' whispered Noodle, 'wilt thou not
come to the one that feeds thee?' and he held out a <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 20]</span> handful of corn. But the Plough gave no
regard to him or his grain: slowly it moved away from him back
into the furrow.</p>
<p>Then Noodle laughed softly and dropped his ring, the
Sweetener, into the hand that held the grain; and barely had he
offered the corn before he felt the silver Plough nozzling at his
palm, and eating as a horse eats from the hand of its master.</p>
<p>Then he whistled again, placing the Sweetener back between his
lips; and the Galloping Plough sprang after him, and followed at
his heels like a dog.</p>
<p>So, finding himself its master, he bid it stay for the night;
and in the morning he said to the farmer, 'Give me my wages, and
let me go!' And the farmer laughed, saying, 'Take your wages, and
go!'</p>
<p>Then Noodle took off his ring, the <span class="pagenum">[pg 21]</span> Sweetener, and laid it between his lips and blew
through it; and up like a moonbeam, and like an Arab mare, sprang
the Galloping Plough at his call. So he leaped upon its back,
crying, 'Carry me away out of this land, O thou moonbeam, and
miracle of beauty, and never slacken nor stay except I bid
thee!'</p>
<p>Vainly the farmer, borne down on a torrent of rage and
amazement, whistled his best, and threw corn and rice from the
rear; for the whistling of Noodle was sweeter to the ear, and his
corn sweeter to the taste, and he nearer to the heart of the
Galloping Plough than was the old master whom it left behind.

<h3>THE THIRSTY WELL</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/028.png" alt="S" class=
"firstletter" />o they escaped, slitting the swift hours with
ungovernable speed. The furrow they two made in the world that
day, as they went shooting over the round of it, was called in
after times the Equator, and men still know it by the heat of it,
though it has since been covered over by the dust of ages.</p>
<p>To Noodle, as he went careering round it, the whole world's
circuit ran in a line across his brain, entering his vision and
passing through it as a thread through the needle's eye. Nor
would he of his own will ever have stopped his galloping, but
<span class="pagenum">[pg 24]</span> that at the completion of
the first round a mighty thirst took hold of him. 'O my
moonbeam,' he said, choking behind parched lips, and sick at
heart, 'check me, or I faint!' And the Galloping Plough stopped
at once, and set him to earth in a green space under the shadow
of overhanging boughs.</p>
<p>He found himself in a richly grown garden, a cool paradise for
a traveller to rest in. Close at hand and inviting to the eye was
a well with a bucket slung ready to be let down. Noodle had
little thought of seeking for the owner of the garden to beg for
a drink, since water is an equal gift to all and the right of any
man; but as he drew near he found the means to it withheld from
him, the lid being fast locked. He went on in search of the
owner, till at length he came upon the same lying half asleep
under a thorn-bush with the key in her hand. She was an old
woman, so <span class="pagenum">[pg 25]</span> withered and dry,
she looked as if no water could have ever passed her lips.</p>
<p>When Noodle asked for a drink from the well, she looked at him
bright and sharp, and said: 'Before any man drinks of my water he
must make a bargain with me.' 'What is the bargain?' asked
Noodle; and she led him down to the well.</p>
<p>Then she unlocked the lid and bade him look in; and at the
sight Noodle knew for a second time that his heart had been
stolen from him, and that to be happy he must taste that water or
die.</p>
<p>Again he asked, with his eyes intent upon the blue wrimpling
of the water in the well's depth, 'What is the bargain?' And the
old woman answered, 'If you fail to draw water out of the well
you must fling yourself into it.' For answer Noodle swung down
the bucket, lowering it as fast as it would go; then he set both
hands to the windlass and wound.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 26]</span>
<p>He heard the water splashing off the sides of the bucket all
the way up, as the shortening rope brought it near; but when he
drew it over the well's brink wonder and grief held him fast, for
the bucket was as empty as vanity. From behind him came a noise
of laughter, and there was the old witch running round and round
in a circle; and everywhere a hedge of thorns came shooting up to
enclose him and keep him fast for her.</p>
<p>'What a trap I am in!' thought Noodle; but once more he
lowered the bucket, and once more it returned to him empty.</p>
<p>The old woman climbed up into the thorn-hedge, and sat on its
top, singing:</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Again Noodle let down the bucket; and this time as he drew it
up he looked over <span class="pagenum">[pg 27]</span> into the
well's heart, and saw all the way up the side a hundred blue arms
reaching out crystal scallops and drawing water out of the bucket
as hard as they could go. He saw thick lips like sea-anemones
thrust out between the crevices of the wall, sucking the crystals
dry as fast as they were filled. 'Truly,' he said to himself,
'this is a thirsty well, but myself am thirstier!'</p>
<p>When he had drawn up the bucket empty for the third time, he
stood considering; and at last he fastened to it the firestone
ring, the Sweetener, and lowered it once more. Then he laughed to
himself as he drew up, and felt the bucket lightening at every
turn till it touched the surface of things.</p>
<p>Empty he found it, with only his firestone hanging by the rim,
and once again he let it down to be refilled. But this time as he
wound up, nothing could keep him from letting a curious eye go
over the <span class="pagenum">[pg 28]</span> brink, to see how
the Well-folk fared over their wine; and in what he beheld there
was already comfort for his soul.</p>
<p>The blue arms went like oars out of unison; like
carpet-beaters stricken in the eyes and throat with dust, they
beat foolishly against the sides and bottom of the bucket,
shattering and letting fall their goblets in each unruly attempt.
And because Noodle wound leniently at the rope, willing that they
should have their fill, at the last gasp they were able to send
the bucket empty to the top. It was the last staving off of
destiny that lay in their power to make; thereafter wine
conquered them.</p>
<p>Quickly Noodle drew out the ring, and sent the bucket flying
on its last errand. It smacked the water, heeled over, and dipped
under a full draught. Then Noodle spun the windlass with the full
pinch of his energies, calling on the bucket <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 29]</span> to ascend. He heard the water spilling
from its sides, and knew that the blue arms were there, battling
to arrest it as it flew, and to pay him back once more with
emptiness and mockery. Yet in spite of them the bucket hasted and
lightened not, but was drawn up to the well's head brimming
largely, and winking a blue eye joyously to the light of day.</p>
<p>Over head and ears Noodle plunged for the quenching of his
thirst, nor stayed nor drew back till his head had smitten upon
the bottom of the bucket in his pursuit of the draught. Then it
was apparent that only a third of the water remained, the rest
having obeyed the imperative suction of his throat, and that the
thirsty well had at last found a master under the eye of
heaven.</p>
<p>In the depth of the bucket the water flashed like a burning
sapphire and swung circling, curling and coiling, tossing this
<span class="pagenum">[pg 30]</span> way and that, as if
struggling to get out. At last with a laugh it threw down the
bucket, and tore back into the well with a crash like
thunder.</p>
<p>Up from the well rose a chant of voices:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Under Heaven, over Hell,</p>
<p>You have broken the spell,</p>
<p>You are lord of the Well.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Noodle stepped over the brink of his new realm, calling the
Well-folk to reach hands for him and bear him down. All round,
the blue arms started out, catching him and handing him on from
one to another ladderwise, down, and down, and down. As he went,
anemone lips came out of the crannies in the wall, and kissed his
feet and hands in token of allegiance. 'You are lord of the
well!' they said, as they passed him each one to the next.</p>
<p>He came to the bottom of the well; under his feet, wherever he
stepped upon its waters, hands came up and sustained <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 31]</span> him. The knowledge of everything that
was there had become his. 'Give me,' he said, 'the crystal cup
that is for him who holds kingship over you; so shall I be lord
of you in all places wherever I go.'</p>
<p>A blue arm reached down and drew up from the water a small
crystal, that burned through the darkness with a blue fire, and
gave it to Noodle. 'Now I am your king, however far from you!'
said Noodle. And they answered, chanting:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Under Heaven, over Hell,</p>
<p>You have broken the spell,</p>
<p>You are lord of the Well.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>'Lift me up!' said he; and the blue arms caught him and lifted
him up; from one to another they passed him in ascending circles,
till he came to the mouth of the well.</p>
<p>There overhead was the old witch, crouching and looking in to
know what had become of him; and her hair hung far <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 32]</span> down over her eyes into the well. He
caught her to him by it over the brink. 'Old witch,' he said,
'you must change places with me now!' and he tossed her down to
the bottom of the well.</p>
<p>She went like a falling shuttlecock, shrieking as she fell;
and as she struck the water, the drowned bodies of the men she
had sent there came to the surface, and caught her by the feet
and hair, and drew her down, making an end of her, as she also
had made of them.</p>

<h3>THE PRINCESS MELILOT</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/040.png" alt="W" class=
"firstletter" />hen Noodle, carrying the crystal with him, set
foot once more upon dry land, straightway he was again upon the
back of the Galloping Plough, with the world flying away under
him. But now weariness came over him, and his head weighed this
way and that, so that earth and sky mixed themselves before his
gaze, and he was so drugged with sleep that he had no wits to bid
the Plough slacken from its speed. Therefore it happened that as
they passed a wood, a hanging bough caught him, and brushed him
like a feather from his place, landing him on a green bosom of
grass, where he <span class="pagenum">[pg 34]</span> slept the
sleep of the weary, nor ever lifted his head to see the Plough
fast disappearing over hill and valley and plain, out of sound of
his voice or sight of his eye.</p>
<p>When Noodle awoke and found that the Plough was gone, he was
bitter against himself for his folly. 'So poor a use to make of
so noble a steed!' he cried; 'no wonder it has gone from me to
seek for a worthier master! If by good fortune I find it again,
needs must I do great things by its aid to be worthy of its
service.' So he set out, following the furrow of its course,
determined, however far he must seek, to journey on till he found
it.</p>
<p>For a whole year he travelled, till at length he came,
footsore and weary, to a deserted palace standing in the midst of
an overgrown garden. The great gates, which lay wide open, were
overrun with creepers, and the paths were green with <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 35]</span> weeds. That morning he had thought that
he saw far away on the hills the gleam of his silver Plough, and
now hope rose high, for he could see by its track that the Plough
had passed before him into the garden of the palace. 'O my
moonbeam,' he thought, 'is it here I shall find you at last?'</p>
<p>Within the garden there was a sound of cross questions and
crooked answers, of many talking with loud voices, and of one
weeping apart from the rest. When he got quite close, he was
struck still with awe, and joy, and wonder. For first there lay
the Galloping Plough in the middle of a green lawn, and round it
a score of serving-men, tugging at it and trying to make it move
on. Near by stood an old woman, wringing her hands and begging
them to leave it alone: 'For,' cried she, 'if the Plough touches
but the feet of the Princess, she will be uprooted, and will
<span class="pagenum">[pg 36]</span> presently wither away and
die. Of what use is it to break one, if the other enchantments
cannot be broken?'</p>
<p>In the centre of the lawn grew a bower of roses, and beneath
the bower stood the loveliest princess that ever eye beheld; but
she stood there motionless, and without sign of life. She seemed
neither to hear, nor see, nor breathe; her feet were rooted to
the ground; though they seemed only to rest lightly under her
weight upon the grass, no man, nor a hundred men, could stir her
from where she stood. And, as the spell that held her fast bound
to the spot, even so was the spell that sealed her
senses,&mdash;no man might lift it from her. When Noodle set eyes
upon her he knew that for the third time his heart had been
stolen from him, and that to be happy he must possess her, or
die.</p>
<p>He ran quickly to the old woman, who, unregarded by the
serving-men, stood <span class="pagenum">[pg 37]</span> weeping
and wringing her hands. 'Tell me, said Noodle, 'who is this
sleeper who stands enchanted and rooted like a flower to earth?
And who are you, and these others who work and cry at cross
purposes?'</p>
<p>The old woman cried from a wide mouth: 'It is my mistress, the
honey-jewel of my heart, whom you see here so grievously
enchanted. All the gifts of the fairies at her christening did
not prevent what was foretold of her at her birth. In her
seventeenth year, as you see her now, so it was told of her that
she should be.'</p>
<p>'Does she live?' asked Noodle; 'is she asleep? She is not
dead; when will she wake? Tell me, old woman, her history, and
how this fate has come upon her.'</p>
<p>'She was the daughter of the king of this country by his first
wife,' said the old woman, 'and heir to the throne after his
<span class="pagenum">[pg 38]</span> death; but when her mother
died the king married again, and the three daughters he had by
his second wife were jealous of the beauty, and charm, and
goodness which raised their sister so high above them in the
estimation of all men. So they asked their mother to teach them a
spell that should rob Melilot of her charms, and make them
useless in the eyes of men. And their mother, who was wise in
such arts, taught to each of them a spell, so that together they
might work their will.</p>
<p>'One day they came running to Melilot, and said, "Come and
play with us a new game that our mother has taught us!" Then they
began turning themselves into flowers. "I will be a hollyhock!"
said one. "And I will be a columbine!" said another; and saying
the spell over each other they became each the flower they had
named.</p>
<p>'Then they unloosed the spells, and <span class="pagenum">[pg 39]</span> became themselves again. "Oh, it is so nice to be a
flower!" they cried, laughing and clapping their hands. But
Melilot knew no spell.</p>
<p>At last, seeing how her sisters turned into flowers, and came
back safe again, "I will be a rose!" she cried; "turn me into a
rose and out again!"</p>
<p>Then her three sisters joined their tongues together, and
finished the spell over her. And so soon as she had become a
rose-tree, the three sisters turned into three moles, and went
down under the earth and gnawed at the roots.</p>
<p>Then they came up, and took their own forms again, and
sang,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sister, sister, here you are now,</p>
<p>Till the ploughman come with the Galloping Plough!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then they turned into bees, and sucked out the honey from the
roses, and coming to themselves again they sang,&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 40]</span>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sister, here you must doze and doze,</p>
<p>Till they bring you a flower of the Burning Rose!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>'Then they shook the dewdrops out of her eyes,
crying,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sister, your brain lies under our spell,</p>
<p>Till water be brought from the Thirsty Well!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>'Then they took the top blossom of all, and broke it to
pieces, and threw the petals away as they cried,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sister, your life goes down for a term,</p>
<p>Till they bring you breath from the Camphor-Worm!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>'And when they had done all this, they turned her back into
her true shape, and left her standing even as you see her now,
without warmth, or sight, or memory, or motion, dead saving for
her beauty, that never changes or dies. And here she must stand
till the spells which have been fastened upon her have been
unloosed. No long time after, the wickedness of the three sisters
and of their cruel mother was <span class="pagenum">[pg 41]</span> discovered to the king, and they were all put to death
for the crime. Yet the ill they had done remained; and the king's
grief became so great to see his loved daughter standing dead
before him that he removed with his court to another place, and
left this palace to the care of only a few serving-men, and
myself to keep watch and guard over the Princess.</p>
<p>'So now four-fold is the spell that holds her, and to break
the lightest of them the water of the Thirsty Well is needed;
with two of its drops laid upon her eyes memory will come back to
her, and her mind will remember of the things of the past. And
for the breaking of the second spell is needed a blossom of the
Burning Rose, and the plucking of that no man's hand can achieve;
but when the Rose is laid upon her breast, her heart will belong
to the world once more, and will beat again under her bosom. And
for <span class="pagenum">[pg 42]</span> the breaking of the
third spell one must bring the breath of the Camphor-Worm that
has lain for a whole year inside its body, and breathe it between
her lips; then she will breathe again, and all her five senses
will return to her. And for the last spell only the Galloping
Plough can uproot her back to life, and free her feet for the
ways of earth. Now, here we have the Galloping Plough with no man
who can guide it, and what aid can it be? If these fools should
be able to make it so much as but touch the feet of my dear
mistress, she will be mown down like grass, and die presently for
lack of earth; for only the three other charms I have told you of
can put whole life back into her.'</p>
<p>'As for the mastery of the Plough,' said Noodle, 'I will fetch
that from them in a breath. See, in a moment, how marvellous will
be the uplifting of their eyes!' He put to his lips the firestone
ring&mdash;the <span class="pagenum">[pg 43]</span>
Sweetener&mdash;and blew but one note through it. Then in a
moment the crowd divided hither and thither, with cries of wonder
and alarm, for the Plough turned and bounded back to its master
quickly, as an Arab mare at the call of her owner.</p>
<p>The old woman, weeping for gladness, cried: 'Thou art master
of the Plough! Art thou master of all the other things as
well?'</p>
<p>He said: 'Of one thing only. Tell me of the Burning Rose and
the Camphor-Worm; what and where are they? For I am the master of
the ends of the earth by reason of the speed with which this
carries me; and I am lord of the Thirsty Well, and have the
Fire-eaters for my friends.'</p>
<p>The old woman clapped her hands, and blessed him for his
youth, and his wisdom, and his courage. 'First,' she said,
'restore to the Princess her memory by means of <span class="pagenum">[pg 44]</span> the water of the Thirsty Well; then I
will show you the way to the Burning Rose, for the easier thing
must be done first.'</p>
<p>Then Noodle drew out the crystal and breathed in it, calling
on the Well-folk for the two drops of water to lay on Princess
Melilot's eyes. Immediately in the bottom of the cup appeared two
blue drops of water, that came climbing up the sides of the glass
and stood trembling together on the brim. And Noodle, touching
them with the firestone ring to make the memory of things sweet
to her, bent back the Princess's face, and let them fall under
her closed lids.</p>
<p>'Look!' cried the faithful nurse, 'light trembles within those
eyes of hers! In there she begins to remember things; but as yet
she sees and hears nothing. Now it is for you to be swift and
fetch her the blossom of the Burning Rose. Be wise, and you shall
not fail!'<br />

<h3>THE BURNING ROSE</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/054.png" alt="S" class=
"firstletter" />he told him how he was to go, across the desert
southward, till he found a giant, longer in length than a day's
journey, lying asleep upon the sand. Over his head, it was told,
hung a cloud, covering him from the heat and resting itself
against his brows; within the cloud was a dream, and within the
dream grew the garden of the Burning Rose. Than this she knew no
more, nor by what means Noodle might gain entrance and become
possessor of the Rose.</p>
<p>Noodle waited for no more; he mounted upon the Galloping
Plough, and pressed <span class="pagenum">[pg 46]</span> away
over the desert to the south. For three days he travelled through
parched places, refreshing himself by the way with the water of
the Thirsty Well, calling on the Well-folk for the replenishment
of his crystal, and turning the draught to wine by the sweetness
of his magic ring.</p>
<p>At length he saw a cloud rising to him from a distance; like a
great opal it hung motionless between earth and heaven. Coming
nearer he saw the giant himself stretched out for a day's journey
across the sand. His head lay under the colours of the dawn, and
his feet were covered with the dusk of evening, and over his
middle shone the noonday sun.</p>
<p>Under the giant's shadow Noodle stopped, and gazed up into the
cloud; through the outer covering of its mists he saw what seemed
to be balls of fire, and knew that within lay the dream and the
garden of the Burning Rose.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 47]</span>
<p>The giant laughed and muttered in his sleep, for the dream was
sweet to him. 'O Rose,' he said, 'O sweet Rose, what end is there
of thy sweetness? How innumerable is the dance of the Roses of my
Rose-garden!'</p>
<p>Noodle caught hold of the ropes of the giant's hair, and
climbed till he sat within the hollow of his right ear. Then he
put to his lips the ring, the Sweetener, and sang till the giant
heard him in his sleep; and the sweet singing mixed itself with
the sweetness of the Rose in the giant's brain, and he muttered
to himself, saying: 'O bee, O sweet bee, O bee in my brain, what
honey wilt thou fetch for me out of the Roses of my
Rose-garden?'</p>
<p>So, more and more, Noodle sweetened himself to the giant, till
the giant passed him into his brain, and into the heart of the
dream, even into the garden of the Burning Rose.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 48]</span>
<p>Far down below the folds of the cloud, Noodle remembered that
the Galloping Plough lay waiting a call from him. 'When I have
stolen the Rose,' thought he, 'I may need swift heels for my
flight.' And he put the Sweetener to his lips and whistled the
Plough up to him.</p>
<p>It came, cleaving the encirclement of clouds like a silver
gleam of moonlight, and for a moment, where they parted, Noodle
saw a rift of blue sky, and the light of the outer world clear
through their midst.</p>
<p>The giant turned uneasily in his sleep, and the garden of the
Burning Rose rocked to its foundations as the edge of things real
pierced into it.</p>
<p>'While I stay here there is danger,' thought Noodle. 'Surely I
must make haste to possess myself of the Rose and to escape!'</p>
<p>All round him was a garden set thick with rose-trees in
myriads of blossom, rose <span class="pagenum">[pg 49]</span>
behind rose as far as the eye could reach, and the fragrance of
them lay like a heavy curtain of sleep upon the senses. Noodle,
beginning to feel drowsy, stretched out his hand in haste to the
nearest flower, lest in a little while he should be no more than
a part of the giant's dream. 'O beloved Heart of Melilot!' he
cried, and crushed his fingers upon the stem.</p>
<p>The whole bough crackled and sprang away at his touch; the
Rose turned upon him, screaming and spouting fire; a noise like
thunder filled all the air. Every rose in the garden turned and
spat flame at where he stood. His face and his hands became
blistered with the heat.</p>
<p>Leaping upon the back of his Plough, he cried, 'Carry me to
the borders of the garden where there are open spaces! The price
of the Princess is upon my head!'</p>
<p>The Plough bounded this way and that, searching for some
outlet by which to <span class="pagenum">[pg 50]</span> escape.
It flew in spirals and circles, it leaped like a flea, it
burrowed like a mole, it ploughed up the rose-trees by the roots.
But so soon as it had passed they stood up unharmed again, and to
whatever point of refuge the Plough fled, that way they all
turned their heads and darted out vomitings of fire.</p>
<p>In vain did Noodle summon the Well-folk to his aid; his
crystal shot forth fountains of water that turned into steam as
they rose, and fell back again, scalding him.</p>
<p>Then with two deaths threatening to devour him, he brandished
the ring, calling upon the Fire-eaters for their aid.</p>
<p>They laughed as they came. 'Here is food for you!' he cried.
'Multiply your appetites about me, or I shall be consumed in
these flames!'</p>
<p>'Brandish again!' cried they&mdash;the same seven whom he had
fed. 'We are not enough; this fire is not quenchable.'</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 51]</span>
<p>Noodle brandished till the whole garden swarmed with their
kind. One fastened himself upon every rose, a gulf opposing
itself to a torrent. All sight of the conflagration disappeared;
but within there went a roaring sound, and the bodies of the
Fire-eaters crackled, growing large and luminous the while.</p>
<p>'Do your will quickly and begone!' cried the Fire-eaters.
'Even now we swell to bursting with the pumping in of these
fires!'</p>
<p>Noodle seized on a rose to which one hung, sucking out its
heats. He tugged, but the strong fibres held. Then he locked
himself to the back of the Plough, crying to it and caressing its
speed with all names under heaven, and beseeching it in the name
of Melilot to break free. And the Plough giving but one plunge,
the Rose came away into Noodle's hand, panting and a prisoner.
All blushing it grew and <span class="pagenum">[pg 52]</span>
radiant, with a soft inner glow, and an odour of incomparable
sweetness. He seemed to see the heart of Melilot beating before
him.</p>
<p>But now there came a blast of fire behind him, for the
Fire-eaters had disappeared, and all was whirling and shaken
before his eyes; and the Plough sped desperately over earthquake
and space. For the plucking of the Rose had awakened the giant
from his sleep; and the dream shrivelled and spun away in a whirl
of flame-coloured vapours. Leaping into clear day out of the
unravelment of its mists, Noodle found himself and his Plough
launching over an edge of precipice for a downward dive into
space. The giant's hair, standing upright from his head in the
wrath and horror of his awakening, made a forest ending in his
forehead that bowered them to right and to left. Quitting it they
slid ungovernably <span class="pagenum">[pg 53]</span> over the
bulge of his brow, and went at full spurt for the abyss.</p>
<p>Dexterously the Plough steered its descent, catching on the
bridge and furrowing the ridge of the nose; nine leagues were the
duration of a second.</p>
<p>The giant, thinking some venomous parasite was injuring his
flesh, aimed, and a moment too late had thumped his fist upon the
place. But already the Plough skirting the amazed opening of his
mouth was lost in the trammels of his beard. Thence, as it
escaped the rummaging of his fingers, it flew scouring his
breast, and inflicted a flying scratch over the regions of his
abdomen. Then, still believing it to be the triumphal procession
of a flea, he pursued it to his thigh, and mistaking the shadow
for the substance allowed it yet again to escape. At his knee-cap
there was but a hair's-breadth between Noodle and the weight of
his thumb; but thereafter <span class="pagenum">[pg 54]</span>
the Plough out-distanced his every effort, and, with Noodle
preserved whole and alive, sped fast and far, bearing the Burning
Rose to the heart of the beloved Melilot.</p>
<p>The crone was aware of his coming before she heard him, or saw
the gleam of his Plough running beam-like over the land. From her
seat by the Princess's bower she clapped her hands, and springing
to his neck ere he alighted: 'A long way off, and a long time
off,' she cried, 'I knew what fortune was with you; for when you
plucked off the Rose, and bore it out of the heart of the dream,
the scent of it filled the world; and I felt the sweetness of
youth once more in my blood.'</p>
<p>Then she led him to the Princess, and bade him lay the Rose in
her breast, that her heart might be won back into the world.
Looking at her face again, Noodle saw how memory had made it more
beautiful <span class="pagenum">[pg 55]</span> than ever, and how
between her lips had grown the tender parting of a smile. Then he
laid the Rose where the movement of the heart should be; and
presently under the white breast rose the music of its
beating.</p>
<p>'Ah!' cried the old nurse, weeping for happiness, 'now her
heart that loved me is come back, and I can listen all day to the
sound of it! You have brought memory to her, you have brought
love; now bring breath, and the awakening of her five senses.
Surely the light of her eyes will be your reward!' <span class="pagenum">[pg 56]</span></p>

youth as he feasted his eyes on the Princess's loveliness, made
more unendurable by the awakening within of love. 'Where and what
is it?' 'It is not so far as was the way to the Burning Rose,'
answered the crone; 'an hour on the back of the Plough shall
bring it near to you; but the danger and difficulty of this quest
is more, not less. For to reach the Camphor-Worm you need to be a
diver in deep waters, whose weight crushes a man; and to touch
its lips you must master the loathing of your nature;
<span class="pagenum">[pg 58]</span> and to carry away its breath
you must have strength of will and endurance beyond what is
mortal.' 'You trouble me with things I need not know,' cried
Noodle. 'Tell me,' he said, 'how I may reach the Camphor-Worm;
and of it and its ways.'</p>
<p>'By this path, and by that,' said the old woman, pointing him,
'go on till you come to the thick waters of the Bitter Lake; they
are blacker than night, and their weight is heavier than lead,
and in the depths dwells the Camphor-Worm. Once a year, when the
air is sweetest with the scents of summer, she rises to breathe,
lifting her black snout through the surface of the waters. Then
she draws fresh air into her lungs, flavoured with leaves and
flowers, and after she has breathed it in she lets go the last
bubble of the breath she drew from the summer of the year before;
and it is this bubble of breath alone that will give back life to
the five senses of Princess <span class="pagenum">[pg 59]</span>
Melilot. But the Worm's time for rising is far; and how you shall
bear the weight in the depths of those waters, or make the Worm
give up the bubble before her time, or at last bear back the
bubble to lay it on the lips of the Princess so that she may
wake,&mdash;these are things I know not the way of, for to my
eyes they seem dark with difficulty and peril.'</p>
<p>Then Noodle, opening the petals of the Burning Rose as it lay
upon the heart of Melilot, drew out honey from its centre,
filling his hand with the golden crumblings of fragrance; and he
leapt upon the Galloping Plough, urging it in the way the
Princess's nurse had pointed out to him. As they went he caressed
it with all the names under heaven, stroking it with his hand and
praising it for the delicacy of its steering: saying, 'O my
moonbeam, if thou wouldst save the life of thy master, or restore
the five senses of <span class="pagenum">[pg 60]</span> the
Princess Melilot, thou must surpass thyself to-day. Listen, thou
heaven-sent limb, thou miracle of quicksilver, and have a long
mind to my words; for in a short while I shall have no speech
left in me till the thing be done, and the deliverance, from head
to feet, of my Beloved accomplished.'</p>
<p>Even while he spoke they came to the edge of the Bitter
Lake&mdash;a small pool, but its waters were blacker than night,
and heavier than lead to the eye. Then Noodle leapt down from the
Plough, and caressed it for the last time, saying: 'Set thy face
for the garden where the Princess Melilot is; and when I am come
back to thee speechless out of the Lake and am striding thee once
more, then wait not for a word but carry me to her with more
speed than thou hast ever mustered to my aid till now; go faster
than wind or lightning or than the eye of man can see! So,
<span class="pagenum">[pg 61]</span> by good fortune, I may live
till I reach her lips; but if thou tarry at all I am a dead man.
And when thou art come to Melilot set thy share beneath the roots
of her feet, and take her up to me out of the ground. Do this
tenderly, but abate not speed till it be done!'</p>
<p>Then the youth put into his mouth the honey of the Burning
Rose, and into his lips the Sweetener, and stripped himself as a
bather to the pool. And the Plough, remembering its master's
word, turned and set its face to where lay the garden with
Melilot waiting to be relieved of her enchantment. Whereat
Noodle, bowing his head, and blessing it with lips of farewell,
turned shortly and slid down into the blackness of the lake.</p>
<p>The weight of that water was like a vice upon his limbs, and
around his throat, as he swam out into the centre of the pool. As
he went he breathed upon the water, <span class="pagenum">[pg 62]</span> and the scent of the honey of the Burning Rose passing
through the Sweetener made an incomparable fragrance, gentle, and
subtle, and wooing to the senses.</p>
<p>When he came to the middle of the lake he stayed breathing
full breaths, till the air deepened with fragrance around him.
Presently underneath him he felt the movement of a great thing
coming up from the bottom of the pool. It touched his feet and
came grazing along his side; and all at once shuddering and
horror took hold upon him, for his whole nature was filled with
loathing of its touch.</p>
<p>Out of the pool's surface before him rose a great black snout,
that opened, showing a round hole. Then he thought of Melilot and
her beauty laid fast under a charm, and drawing a full breath he
laid his lips containing the ring, the Sweetener, to the lips of
the Worm.</p>
<p>The Worm began to breathe. As the <span class="pagenum">[pg 63]</span> Worm drank the air out of him, he drew in more through
his nostrils, and more and more, till the great gills were filled
and satisfied.</p>
<p>Then the Worm let go the last bubble of air which remained
from the year before, and had lain ever since in its body, by
which alone life could be given back to the five senses of
Melilot. Then drawing in its head it lowered itself once more to
the bottom of the pool; and Noodle, feeling in his mouth the
precious globule of air, fastened his lips upon it and shot out
for shore.</p>
<p>Against the weight of those leaden waters a longing to gasp
possessed him; but he knew that with the least breath the bubble
would be lost, and all his labour undone. Not too soon his feet
caught hold of the bank, and drew him free to land. He cast
himself speechless across the back of the Galloping Plough and
clung.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 64]</span>
<p>The Plough gathered itself together and sprang away through
space. Remembering its master's word it showed itself a miracle
of speed; like lightning became its flight.</p>
<p>The eye of Noodle grew blind to the passing of things; he
could take no count of the collapsing leagues. More and more grew
the amazingness of the Plough's leaps, things only to be measured
by miles, and counted as joltings on the way; while fast to the
back of it clung Noodle, and endured, praying that shortness of
breath might not overmaster him, or the check of his lungs give
way and burst him to the emptiness of a drum. His senses rocked
and swayed; he felt the gates of his resolve slackening and
forcing themselves apart; and still the Galloping Plough plunged
him blindly along through space.</p>
<p>But now the shrill crying of the crone <span class="pagenum">[pg 65]</span> struck in upon his ears, and he
stretched open his arms for the accomplishment of the
deliverance. Even in that nick of time was the end of the thing
brought about; for the Plough, guiding itself as a thread to the
needle's eye, gave the uprooting stroke to the white feet of
Melilot; and Noodle, swooning for the last gasp, saw all at once
her beauty swaying level to his gaze and her body bending down
upon his.</p>
<p>Then he fastened his lips upon hers, and loosed the bubble
from his mouth; and panting and sobbing themselves back to life
they hung in each other's arms. She warmed and ripened in his
embrace, opening upon him the light of her eyes; and the
greatness and beauty of the reward abashed him and bore him down
to earth.</p>
<p>He heard the old crone clucking and crowing, like a hen over
its egg, of the happiness that had come to her old years; till
recognising the youth's state she <span class="pagenum">[pg 66]</span> covered him over with a cloak amid exclamations of
astonishment.</p>
<p>The Princess saw nothing but her lover's face and the happy
feasting of his eyes. She bent her head nearer and nearer to his,
and the story of what he had done became a dream that she
remembered, and that waking made true. 'O you Noodle,' she said,
laughing, 'you wise, wise Noodle!' And then everything was
finished, for she had kissed him!</p>
<p>So Noodle and the Princess were married, and came to the
throne together and reigned over a happy land. The Fire-eaters
were their friends, and the gifts of fortune were theirs. The
Galloping Plough made all the waste places fertile; and the water
of the Thirsty Well rose and ran in rivers through the land; and
over the walls of their palace, where they had planted it, grew
the flower of the Burning Rose.</p>

<h3>THE CROWN'S WARRANTY</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/078.png" alt="F" class=
"firstletter" />ive hundred years ago or more a king died,
leaving two sons: one was the child of his first wife, and the
other of his second, who surviving him became his widow. When the
king was dying he took off the royal crown which he wore, and set
it upon the head of the elder born, the son of his first wife,
and said to him: 'God is the lord of the air, and of the water,
and of the dry land: this gift cometh to thee from God. Be
merciful, over whatsoever thou holdest power, as God is!' And
saying these words he laid his hands upon the heads of his two
sons and died.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 70]</span>
<p>Now this crown was no ordinary crown, for it was made of the
gold brought by the Wise men of the East when they came to
worship at Bethlehem. Every king that had worn it since then had
reigned well and uprightly and had been loved by all his people:
but only to himself was it known what virtue lay in his crown;
and every king at dying gave it to his son with the same words of
blessing.</p>
<p>So, now, the king's eldest son wore the crown; and his
step-mother knew that her own son could not wear it while he
lived, therefore she looked on and said nothing. Now he was known
to all the people of his country, because of his right to the
throne, as the king's son; and his brother, the child of the
second wife, was called the queen's son. But as yet they were
both young, and cared little enough for crowns.</p>
<p>After the king's death the queen was <span class="pagenum">[pg 71]</span> made regent till the king's son should be come to a
full age; but already the little king wore the royal crown his
father had left him, and the queen looked on and said
nothing.</p>
<p>More than three years went by, and everybody said how good the
queen was to the little king who was not her own son; and the
king's son, for his part, was good to her and to his
step-brother, loving them both; and all by himself he kept
thinking, having his thoughts guarded and circled by his golden
crown, 'How shall I learn to be a wise king, and to be merciful
when I have power, as God is?'</p>
<p>So to everything that came his way, to his playthings and his
pets, to his ministers and his servants, he played the king as
though already his word made life and death. People watching him
said, 'Everything that has touch with the king's son loves him.'
They told strange tales of <span class="pagenum">[pg 72]</span>
him: only in fairy books could they be believed, because they
were so beautiful; and all the time the queen, getting a good
name for herself, looked on and said nothing.</p>
<p>One night the king's son was lying half-asleep upon his bed,
with wise dreams coming and going under the circle of his gold
crown, when a mouse ran out of the wainscot and came and jumped
up upon the couch. The poor mouse had turned quite white with
fear and horror, and was trembling in every limb as it cried its
news into the king's ear. 'O king's son,' it said, 'get up and
run for your life! I was behind the wainscot in the queen's
closet, and this is what I heard: if you stay here, when you wake
up to-morrow you will be dead!'</p>
<p>The king's son got up, and all alone in the dark night stole
out of the palace, seeking safety for his dear life. He sighed
<span class="pagenum">[pg 73]</span> to himself, 'There was a
pain in my crown ever since I wore it. Alas, mother, I thought
you were too kind a step-mother to do this!'</p>
<p>Outside it was still winter: there was no warmth in the world,
and not a leaf upon the trees. He wandered away and away,
wondering where he should hide.</p>
<p>The queen, when her villains came and told her the king's son
was not to be found, went and looked in her magic crystal to find
trace of him. As soon as it grew light, for in the darkness the
crystal could show her nothing, she saw many miles away the
king's son running to hide himself in the forest. So she sent out
her villains to search until they should find him.</p>
<p>As they went the sun grew hot in the sky, and birds began
singing. 'It is spring!' cried the messengers. 'How suddenly it
has come!' They rode on till they came to the forest.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 74]</span>
<p>The king's son, stumbling along through the forest under the
bare boughs, thought, 'Even here where shall I hide? Nowhere is
there a leaf to cover me.' But when the sun grew warm he looked
up; and there were all the trees breaking into bud and leaf,
making a green heaven above his head. So when he was too weary to
go farther, he climbed into the largest tree he could find; and
the leaves covered him.</p>
<p>The queen's messengers searched through all the forest but
could not find him; so they went back to her empty handed, not
having either the king's crown or his heart to show. 'Fools!' she
cried, looking in her magic crystal, 'he was in the big sycamore
under which you stopped to give your horses provender!'</p>
<p>The sycamore said to the king's son, 'The queen's eye is on
you; get down and run for your life till you get to the
hollow
<span class="pagenum">[pg 75]</span> tarn-stones among the hills!
But if you stay here, when you wake to-morrow you will be dead.'</p>
<p>When the queen's messengers came once more to the forest they
found it all wintry again, and without leaf; only the sycamore
was in full green, clapping its hands for joy in the keen and
bitter air.</p>
<p>The messengers searched, and beat down the leaves, but the
king's son was not there. They went back to the queen. She looked
long in her magic crystal, but little could she see; for the
king's son had hidden himself in a small cave beside the
tarn-stones, and into the darkness the crystal could not pry.</p>
<p>Presently she saw a flight of birds crossing the blue, and
every bird carried a few crumbs of bread in its beak. Then she
ran and called to her villains, 'Follow the birds, and they will
take you to where the little wizard is; for they are carrying
<span class="pagenum">[pg 76]</span> bread to feed him, and they
are all heading for the tarn-stones up on the hills.'</p>
<p>The birds said to the king's son, 'Now you are rested; we have
fed you, and you are not hungry. The queen's eye is on you. Up,
and run for your life! If you stay here, when you wake up
to-morrow you will be dead.'</p>
<p>'Where shall I go?' said the king's son. 'Go,' answered the
birds, 'and hide in the rushes on the island of the pool of sweet
waters!'</p>
<p>When the queen's messengers came to the tarn-stones, it was as
though five thousand people had been feeding: they found crumbs
enough to fill twelve baskets full, lying in the cave; but no
king's son could they lay their hands on.</p>
<p>The king's son was lying hidden among the rushes on the island
of the great pool of sweet waters; and thick and fast came
silver-scaled fishes, feeding him.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 77]</span>
<p>It took the queen three days of hard gazing in her crystal,
before she found how the fishes all swam to a point among the
rushes of the island in the pool of sweet waters, and away again.
Then she knew: and running to her messengers she cried: 'He is
among the rushes on the island in the pool of sweet waters; and
all the fishes are feeding him!'</p>
<p>The fishes said to the king's son: 'The queen's eye is on you;
up, and swim to shore, and away for your life! For if they come
and find you here, when you wake to-morrow you will certainly be
dead.'</p>
<p>'Where shall I go?' asked the king's son. 'Wherever I go, she
finds me.' 'Go to the old fox who gets his poultry from the
palace, and ask him to hide you in his burrow!'</p>
<p>When the queen's messengers came to the pool they found the
fishes playing at <span class="pagenum">[pg 78]</span>
<i>alibis</i> all about in the water; but nothing of the king's
son could they see.</p>
<p>The king's son came to the fox, and the fox hid him in his
burrow, and brought him butter and eggs from the royal dairy.
This was better fare than the king's son had had since the
beginning of his wanderings, and he thanked the fox warmly for
his friendship. 'On the contrary,' said the fox, 'I am under an
obligation to you; for ever since you came to be my guest I have
felt like an honest man.' 'If I live to be king,' said the king's
son, 'you shall always have butter and eggs from the royal dairy,
and be as honest as you like.'</p>
<p>The queen hugged her magic crystal for a whole week, but could
make nothing out of it: for her crystal showed her nothing of the
king's son's hiding-place, nor of the fox at his nightly thefts
of butter and eggs from the royal dairy. <span class="pagenum">[pg 79]</span> But it so happened that this same fox
was a sort of half-brother of the queen's; and so guilty did he
feel with his brand-new good conscience that he quite left off
going to see her. So in a little while the queen, with her
suspicions and her magic crystal, had nosed out the young king's
hiding-place.</p>
<p>The fox said to the king's son: 'The queen's eye is on you!
Get out and run for your life, for if you stay here till
to-morrow, you will wake up and find yourself a dead goose!'</p>
<p>'But where else can I go to?' asked the king's son. 'Is there
any place left for me?' The fox laughed, and winked, and
whispered a word; and all at once the king's son got up and
went.</p>
<p>The queen had said to her messengers, 'Go and look in the
fox's hole; and you shall find him!' But the messengers came and
dug up the burrow, and found <span class="pagenum">[pg 80]</span>
butter and eggs from the royal dairy, but of the king's son never
a sign.</p>
<p>The king's son came to the palace, and as he crept through the
gardens he found there his little brother alone at
play,&mdash;playing sadly because now he was all alone. Then the
king's son stopped and said, 'Little brother, do you so much wish
to be king?' And taking off the crown, he put it upon his
brother's head. Then he went on through underground ways and
corridors, till he came to the palace dungeons.</p>
<p>Now a dungeon is a hard thing to get out of, but it is easy
enough to get into. He came to the deepest and darkest dungeon of
all, and there he opened the door, and went in and hid
himself.</p>
<p>The queen's son came running to his mother, wearing the king's
crown. 'Oh, mother,' he said, 'I am frightened! while I was
playing, my brother came
<span class="pagenum">[pg 81]</span> looking all dead and white,
and put this crown on my head. Take it off for me, it hurts!'</p>
<p>When the queen saw the crown on her son's head, she was
horribly afraid; for that it should have so come there was the
most unlikely thing of all. She fetched her crystal ball, and
looked in, asking where the king's son might be, and, for answer,
the crystal became black as night.</p>
<p>Then said the queen to herself, 'He is dead at last!'</p>
<p>But, now that the king's crown was on the wrong head, the air,
and the water, and the dry land, over which God is lord, heard of
it. And the trees said, 'Until the king's son returns, we will
not put forth bud or leaf!'</p>
<p>And the birds said, 'We will not sing in the land, or breed or
build nests until the king's son returns!'</p>
<p>And the fishes said, 'We will not stay <span class="pagenum">[pg 82]</span> in the ponds or rivers to get caught,
unless the king's son, to whom we belong, returns!'</p>
<p>And the foxes said, 'Unless the king's son returns, we will
increase and multiply exceedingly and be like locusts in the
land!'</p>
<p>So all through that land the trees, though it was spring,
stayed as if it were mid-winter; and all the fishes swam down to
the sea; and all the birds flew over the sea, away into other
countries; and all the foxes increased and multiplied, and became
like locusts in the land.</p>
<p>Now when the trees, and the birds, and the beasts, and the
fishes led the way the good folk of the country discovered that
the queen was a criminal. So, after the way of the flesh, they
took the queen and her little son, and bound them, and threw them
into the deepest and darkest dungeon they could find; and said
they: 'Until <span class="pagenum">[pg 83]</span> you tell us
where the king's son is, there you stay and starve!'</p>
<p>The king's son was playing all alone in his dungeon with the
mice who brought him food from the palace larder, when the queen
and her son were thrown down to him fast bound, as though he were
as dangerous as a den of lions. At first he was terribly afraid
when he found himself pursued into his last hiding-place; but
presently he gathered from the queen's remarks that she was quite
powerless to do him harm.</p>
<p>'Oh, what a wicked woman I am!' she moaned; and began crying
lamentably, as if she hoped to melt the stone walls which formed
her prison.</p>
<p>Presently her little son cried, 'Mother, take off my brother's
crown; it pricks me!' And the king's son sat in his corner, and
cried to himself with grief over the harm that his step-mother's
wickedness had brought about.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 84]</span>
<p>'Mother,' cried the queen's son again, 'night and day since I
have worn it, it pricks me; I cannot sleep!'</p>
<p>But the queen's heart was still hard; not if she could help,
would she yet take off from her son the crown.</p>
<p>Hours went by, and the queen and her son grew hungry. 'We
shall be starved to death!' she cried. 'Now I see what a wicked
woman I am!'</p>
<p>'Mother,' cried the queen's son, 'some one is putting food
into my mouth!' 'No one,' said the queen, 'is putting any into
mine. Now I know what a wicked woman I am!'</p>
<p>Presently the king's son came to the queen also, and began
feeding her. 'Someone is putting food into <i>my</i> mouth, now!'
cried the queen. 'If it is poisoned I shall die in agony! I
wish,' she said, 'I wish I knew your brother were not dead; if I
have killed him what a wicked woman I am!'</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 85]</span>
<p>'Dear step-mother,' said the king's son 'I am not dead, I am
here.'</p>
<p>'Here?' cried the queen, shaking with fright. 'Here? not dead!
How long have you been here?'</p>
<p>'Days, and days, and days,' said the king's son, sadly.</p>
<p>'Ah! if I had only known <i>that</i>!' cried the queen.
'<i>Now</i> I know what a wicked woman I am!'</p>
<p>Just then, the trap-door in the roof of the dungeon opened,
and a voice called down, 'Tell us where is the king's son! If you
do not tell us, you shall stay here and starve.'</p>
<p>'The king's son is here!' cried the queen.</p>
<p>'A likely story!' answered the gaolers. 'Do you think we are
going to believe that?' And they shut-to the trap.</p>
<p>The queen's son cried, 'Dear brother, come and take back your
crown, it pricks <span class="pagenum">[pg 86]</span> so!' But
the king's son only undid the queen's bonds and his brother's.
'Now,' said he, 'you are free: you can kill me now.'</p>
<p>'Oh!' cried the queen, 'what a wicked woman I must be! Do you
think I could do it now?' Then she cried, 'O little son, bring
your poor head to me, and I will take off the crown!' and she
took off the crown and gave it back to the king's son. 'When I am
dead,' she said, 'remember, and be kind to him!'</p>
<p>The king's son put the crown upon his own head.</p>
<p>Suddenly, outside the palace, all the land broke into leaf;
there was a rushing sound in the river of fishes swimming up from
the sea, and all the air was loud and dark with flights of
returning birds. Almost at the same moment the foxes began to
disappear and diminish, and cease to be like locusts in the
land.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 87]</span>
<p>People came running to open the door of the deepest and
darkest dungeon in the palace: 'For either,' they cried, 'the
queen is dead, or the king's son has been found!'</p>
<p>'Where is the king's son, then?' they called out, as they
threw wide the door. 'He is here!' cried the king; and out he
came, to the astonishment of all, wearing his crown, and leading
his step-mother and half-brother by the hand.</p>
<p>He looked at his step-mother, and she was quite white; as
white as the mouse that had jumped upon the king's bed at
midnight bidding him fly for his life. Not only her face, but her
hair, her lips, and her very eyes were white and colourless, for
she had gone blind from gazing too hard into her crystal ball,
and hunting the king's son to death.</p>
<p>So she remained blind to the end of her days; but the king was
more good to <span class="pagenum">[pg 88]</span> her than gold,
and as for his brother, never did half-brothers love each other
better than these. Therefore they all lived very happily
together, and after a long time, the queen learned to forget what
a wicked woman she had been.</p>

<h3>THE WISHING-POT</h3>
<p>Tulip was the son of a poor but prudent mother; from the
moment of his birth she had trained him to count ten before ever
he wanted or asked for anything. An otherwise reckless youth, he
acquired an intrinsic value through the practice of this habit.
Only once, just as he was reaching, but had not quite reached,
years of discretion, did his habit of precaution fail him; and
this same failure became in the end the opening of his
fortunes.</p>
<p>Bathing one day in the river, to whose banks the woods ran
down in steep <span class="pagenum">[pg 92]</span> terraces, he
heard a voice come singing along one of the upper slopes; and
looking up under the boughs of cedar and sycamore, he saw a pair
of green feet go dancing by, up and down like grasshoppers on the
prance.</p>
<p>There was such rhythm in them, and such sweetness in the
voice, that his heart was out of him before he could harness it
to the number ten, and he came out of the water the most natural
and forlorn of lovers.</p>
<p>Before he was dressed the green feet and the voice were gone,
and before he got home his health and his appetite seemed to have
gone also. He pined industriously from day to day, and spent all
his hours in searching among the woods by the river side for his
lady of the dear green feet. He did not know so much as the size
or colour of her face; the sound of her voice alone, and the
running up <span class="pagenum">[pg 93]</span> and down of her
feet, had, as he told his mother, 'decimated his affections.'</p>
<p>In his trouble he could think of only one possible remedy, and
that he counted well over, knowing its risk. Away in the
loneliest part of the forest there lived a wise woman, to whom,
now and then, folk went for help when everything else had failed
them. So he had heard tell of a certain Wishing-Pot that was hers
in which people might see the thing they desired most, and into
which for a fee she allowed lovers and other poor fools of
fortune to look. One thing, however, was told against the virtues
of this Wishing-Pot, that though many had had a sight of it, and
their wishes revealed to them therein, others had gone and had
never again returned to their homes, but had vanished altogether
from men's sight, nor had any news ever been heard of them after.
There were some wise folk who <span class="pagenum">[pg 94]</span> held that they had only gone elsewhere to seek the
fortune that the Wishing-Pot had shown to them. Nevertheless, for
the most part the wise woman and her Wishing-Pot had an ill name
in that neighbourhood.</p>
<p>To a lover's heart risk gives value; so one fine morning Tulip
kissed his mother, counted ten, and set out for the woods.</p>
<p>Towards evening he came to the house of the witch and knocked
at the door. 'Good mother,' said he, when she opened to him, 'I
have brought you the fee to buy myself a wish over the
Wishing-Pot.' 'Ay, surely,' answered the crone, and drew him
in.</p>
<p>In one corner of the room stood a great crystal bowl. Nearly
round it was, and had a small opening at the top, to which a man
might place his eye and look in. To Tulip, as he looked at it, it
seemed all coloured fires and falling stars, and a soft crackling
sound came from it, as though <span class="pagenum">[pg 95]</span> heat burned in its veins. It threw long shapes and
lustres upon the walls, and within innumerable things writhed,
and ran, and whiffed in the floating of its vapours.</p>
<p>'You may have two wishes,' said the old witch, 'a one and a
two.' And she said the spell that undid the secret of the Pot to
the wisher.</p>
<p>Then Tulip bent down his head and looked in, counting softly
to himself, and at ten, he let the wish go to his lady of the
dear green feet.</p>
<p>The colours changed and sprang, as though stirred and fed with
fresh fuel; and down in the depths of the Wishing-Pot he saw the
feet of his Beloved go by in twinkling green slippers.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw that he began counting ten in great haste
for the second wish. 'O to be inside the Wishing-Pot with her!'
was his thought now. He had got <span class="pagenum">[pg 96]</span> to nine, and the wish was almost on his tongue, when
he caught sight of the old woman's eye looking at him. And the
eye had become like a large green spider, with great long limbs
that kept clutching up and out again!</p>
<p>His heart queegled to a jelly at the sight; but the green feet
lured him so, that he still thought how to get to them and yet be
safe. Surely, to be in the Wishing-Pot and out by the sound of
the next Angelus became the shape of his wish. He shut his eyes,
cried ten upon the venture, and was in the Wishing-Pot!</p>
<p>The little green feet were trebling over the glass with a
sound like running water; and he himself began running at full
speed, shot off into the Wishing-Pot like a pellet from a
pop-gun. Nothing could he see of his dear but her wee green feet.
But above them as they ran he heard showery laughter, and he knew
that his lady was <span class="pagenum">[pg 97]</span> there
before him, though invisible to the eye.</p>
<p>The Pot, now he was in it, seemed bigger than the biggest dome
in the world; to run all round it took him two or three minutes.
Away in the centre of its base stood a great opal knob, like the
axle to a wheel round which he and the green feet kept
circling.</p>
<p>However much he wished and wished, the green feet still kept
their distance, for now he was <i>in</i> the Wishing-Pot wishes
availed him nothing. The green feet flew faster than his; the
light laugh rang further and further away; right across to the
other side of the hall his lady had passed from him now.</p>
<p>The magic fires of the crystal leapt and crackled under his
tread; now it seemed as if his feet ran on a green lawn, out of
which broke crocuses and daffodils, and now roses reddened in the
track, and now <span class="pagenum">[pg 98]</span> the purple
of grapes spurted across the path like spilled wine. The sound of
the green feet and the running of overhead laughter, as they
distanced him in front, came nearer and nearer behind him from
across the hall. He felt that he must follow and not turn,
however beaten he might be.</p>
<p>Presently a voice, that he knew was his Beloved's,
cried,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Heart that would have me must hatch me!</p>
<p>Feet that would find me must catch me!</p>
<p>Man that would mate me must match me!'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Oh, how? wondered spent feet, and failing heart, and reeling
brain. He stumbled slower and slower in the race, till presently
with quick innumerable patterings the green feet grew closer, and
were overtaking him from the rear.</p>
<p>Warm breath was in his hair,&mdash;lips and a hand; he turned,
open armed, to snatch the mischievous morsel, but all that he
<span class="pagenum">[pg 99]</span> clasped was a gust of air;
and he saw the green feet scudding out and away on a fresh start
before him.</p>
<p>Again, with laughter, the voice cried,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Lap for lap you must wind me:</p>
<p>Equal, before you can find me!</p>
<p>You are a lap behind me!'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Where they raced the surface of the glass sloped slightly to
the upward rise of its walls; Tulip shifted his ground, and ran
where the footing was leveller toward the centre, and the circle
began to go smaller. So he began to gain, till the green
slippers, seeing how the advantage had come about, shifted also
in their turn.</p>
<p>Thus they ran on; there were no inner posts to mark the
course, only the great opal standing in the centre of all formed
the pivot of the race, and round and round it, a great way off,
they ran.</p>
<p>All at once a big thought came into <span class="pagenum">[pg 100]</span> Tulip's head; he waited not to count ten, but, before
Green Slippers knew what he was after, he had reached the opal
centre, and was circling it. Then quickly all the laughter
stopped; the green feet came twinkling sixteens to the dozens, so
as to get round the post before him and away.</p>
<p>One lap, he was before her; two laps, he turned again to her
coming, and found her falling into his arms. She blossomed into
sight at his touch: from top to toe she was there! All rosy and
alive he had her in his clasp, laughing, crying, clinging, yet
struggling to be free. She made a most endless handful, till
Tulip had caught her by the hair and kissed her between the
eyes.</p>
<p>All round and overhead the magic crystal reared up arches of
fire, to a roof that dropped like rain, while Tulip and his prize
sank down exhausted on the great hub of opal to rest. As he
touched it all <span class="pagenum">[pg 101]</span> the secret
wonders of the Wishing-Pot were opened and revealed to his
gaze.</p>
<p>Crowds and crowds of faces were what he most saw; everywhere
that he turned he saw old friends and neighbours who, he thought,
had been dead and gone, looking sadly, and shaking long sorrowful
faces at him. 'You here too, Tulip?' they seemed forever to be
saying. 'Always another, and another; and now you here too!'</p>
<p>There was the dairyman's wife, who had waited seven years to
have a child, holding a little will-o'-the-wisp of a thing in her
arms. Now and then for a while it would lie still, and then
suddenly it would leap up and dart away; and she, poor soul, must
up and after it, though the chase were ever so long!</p>
<p>There also was Miller Dick with his broad thumbs, counting
over a rich pile of gold, which, ever and anon, spun up into the
air, and went strewing itself like <span class="pagenum">[pg 102]</span> dead leaves before the wind. Then he too must needs
up and after it, till it was all caught again, and added
together, and made right.</p>
<p>There were small playmates of Tulip's childhood, each with its
little conceit of treasure: one had a toy, and another a lamb,
another a bird; and all of them hunted and caught the thing they
loved, and kissed it and again let go. So it went on, over and
over again, more sad than the sight of a quaker as he twiddles
his thumbs.</p>
<p>Whenever they were at peace for a moment, they turned their
eyes his way. 'What, you here too, Tulip?' was always the thing
they seemed to be saying.</p>
<p>While Tulip sat looking at them, and thinking of it all,
suddenly his lady disappeared, and only her green feet darted
from his side and began running round and round in a circle. Then
was he just about to set off running after them, when
<span class="pagenum">[pg 103]</span> he felt himself caught up
to the coloured fires of the roof and sent spinning ungovernably
through space. Suddenly he was dumped to the ground, and just as
his feet were gathering themselves up under him he heard the
Angelus bell ringing from the village below the slopes of the
wood.</p>
<p>He was standing again by the side of the Wishing-Pot, and the
old woman sat cowering, and blinking her spider-eye at him, too
much astonished to speak or move.</p>
<p>Tulip looked at her with a pleasant and engaging air. 'Oh,
good mother, what a treat you have given me!' he said. 'How I
wish I had money for another wish! what a pity it was ever to
have wished myself back again!'</p>
<p>When the old witch heard that she thought still to entrap him,
and answered joyfully, 'Why, kind Sir, surely, kind Sir,
<span class="pagenum">[pg 104]</span> if you like it you shall
look again! Take another wish, and never mind about the money.'
So she said the spell once more which opened to him the wonders
of the Wishing-Pot.</p>
<p>Then cried Tulip, clapping his hands, 'What better can I wish
than to have you in the Wishing-Pot, in the place of all those
poor folk whom you have imprisoned with their wishes!'</p>
<p>Hardly was the thing said than done; all the children who had
been Tulip's playmates, and Miller Dick with his broad thumbs,
and the dairyman's wife, were every one of them out, and the old
witch woman was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>But Tulip put his eye to the mouth of the Wishing-Pot; and
there down below he saw the old witch, running round and round as
hard as she could go, pursued by a herd of green spiders. And
there without doubt she remains.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 105]</span>
<p>And now everybody was happy except Tulip himself; for the
children had all of them their toys, and the old miller his gold,
and as for the dairyman's wife, she found that she had become the
mother of a large and promising infant. But Tulip had altogether
lost his lady of the dear green feet, for in thinking of others
he had forgotten to think of himself. All the gratitude of the
poor people he had saved was nothing to him in that great loss
which had left him desolate. For his part he only took the
Wishing-Pot up under his arm, and went sadly away home.</p>
<p>But before long the noise of what he had done reached to the
king's ears; and he sent for Tulip to appear before him and his
Court. Tulip came, carrying the Wishing-Pot under his arm, very
downcast and sad for love of the lady of the dear green feet.</p>
<p>At that time all the Court was in half <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 106]</span> mourning; for the Princess Royal, who
was the king's only child, and the most beautiful and
accomplished of her sex, had gone perfectly distraught with
grief, of which nothing could cure her. All day long she sat with
her eyes shut, and tears running down, and folded hands and quiet
little feet. And all this came, it was said, from a dream which
she could not tell or explain to anybody.</p>
<p>The king had promised that whoever could rouse her from her
grief, should have the princess for his wife, and become heir to
the throne; and when he heard that there was such a thing in the
world as a Wishing-Pot, he thought that something might be done
with it.</p>
<p>From Tulip he learned, however, that no one knew the spell
which opened the resources of the Wishing-Pot save the old witch
woman who was shut up fast for ever in its inside. So it seemed
to <span class="pagenum">[pg 107]</span> the king that the Pot
could be of no use for curing the princess.</p>
<p>But it was so beautiful, with its shooting stars and coloured
fires, that, when Tulip brought it, they carried it in to show to
her.</p>
<p>After three hours the princess was prevailed upon to open her
eyes; and directly they fell upon the great opal bowl, all at
once she started to her feet and began laughing and dancing and
singing.</p>
<p>These are the words that they heard her sing,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Lap for lap I must wind you;</p>
<p>Equal, before I can find you;</p>
<p>I am a lap behind you!'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Tulip, as soon as he heard the sweetness of that voice, and
the words, pushed his way past the king and all his court, to
where the princess was. And there over the heads of the crowd he
saw his lady <span class="pagenum">[pg 108]</span> of the dear
green feet laughing and opening her white arms to him.</p>
<p>As she set eyes on his face the dream of the princess came
true, and all her unhappiness passed from her. So they loved and
were married, to the astonishment and edification of the whole
court; and lived to be greatly loved and admired by all their
grandchildren.</p>

<h3>THE FEEDING OF THE EMIGRANTS</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/120.png" alt="O" class=

their other home where the sun was. The rustle of their wings,
high over head, could be heard down on the water; and their soft,
shrill twitterings, and the thirsty nibbling of their beaks; for
the seas were hushed, and the winds hung away in cloud-land.</p>
<p>Far away from any shore, and beginning to be weary, their eyes
caught sight of a white form resting between sky and sea. Nearer
they came, till it seemed to be a great white bird, brooding on
the calmed water; and its wings were stretched high <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 112]</span> and wide, yet it stirred not. And the
wings had in themselves no motion, but stood rigidly poised over
their own reflection in the water.</p>
<p>Then the birds came curiously, dropping from their straight
course, to wonder at the white wings that went not on. And they
came and settled about this great, bird-like thing, so still and
so grand.</p>
<p>Onto the deck crept a small child, for the noise of the birds
had come down to him in the hold. 'There is nobody at home but
me,' he said; for he thought the birds must have come to call,
and he wished to be polite. 'They are all gone but me,' he went
on, 'all gone. I am left alone.'</p>
<p>The birds, none of them understood him; but they put their
heads on one side and looked down on him in a friendly way,
seeming to consider.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 113]</span>
<p>He ran down below and fetched up a pannikin of water and some
biscuit. He set the water down, and breaking the biscuit
sprinkled it over the white deck. Then he clapped his hands to
see them all flutter and crowd round him, dipping their bright
heads to the food and drink he gave them.</p>
<p>They might not stay long, for the waterlogged ship could not
help them on the way they wished to go; and by sunset they must
touch land again. Away they went, on a sudden, the whole crew of
them, and the sound of their voices became faint in the bright
sea-air.</p>
<p>'I am left alone!' said the child.</p>
<p>Many days ago, while he was asleep in a snug corner he had
found for himself, the captain and crew had taken to the boats,
leaving the great ship to its fate. And forgetting him because he
was so small, or thinking that he was safe in <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 114]</span> some one of the other boats, the rough
sailors had gone off without him, and he was left alone. So for a
whole week he had stayed with the ship, like a whisper of its
vanished life amid the blues of a deep calm. And the birds came
to the ship only to desert it again quickly, because it stood so
still upon the sea.</p>
<p>But that night the mermen came round the vessel's side, and
sang; and the wind rose to their singing, and the sea grew rough.
Yet the child slept with his head in dreams. The dreams came from
the mermen's songs, and he held his breath, and his heart stayed
burdened by the deep sweetness of what he saw.</p>
<p>Dark and strange and cold the sea-valleys opened before him;
blue sea-beasts ranged there, guarded by strong-finned shepherds,
and fishes like birds darted to and fro, but made no sound. And
that was what burdened his heart,&mdash;that for <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 115]</span> all the beauty he saw, there was no
sound, no song of a single bird to comfort him.</p>
<p>The mermen reached out their blue arms to him, and sang; on
the top of the waves they sang, striving to make him forget the
silence of the land below. They offered him the sea-life: why
should he be drowned and die?</p>
<p>And now over him in the dark night the great wings crashed,
and beat abroad in the wind, and the ship made great way. And the
mermen swam fast to be with her, and ceased from their own song,
for the wind sang a coronach in the canvas and cordage. But the
little child lifted his head in his sleep and smiled, for his
soul was eased of the mermen's song, and it seemed to him that
instead he heard birds singing in a far-off land, singing of a
child whose loving hand had fed them, faint and weary, in their
way over the wide ocean.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 116]</span>
<p>In that far southern land the dawn had begun, and the birds,
waking one by one, were singing their story of him to the
soft-breathing tamarisk boughs. And none of them knew how they
had been sent as a salvage crew to save the child's spirit from
the spell of the sea-dream, and to carry it safely back to the
land that loved him.</p>
<p>But with the child's body the white wings had flown down into
the wave-buried valleys, and to a cleft of the sea-hills to
rest.</p>

<h3>THE PASSIONATE PUPPETS</h3>
<p><img width="7%" src="images/128.png" alt="W" class=
"firstletter" />hen the long days of summer began, Killian, the
cow-herd, was able to lead his drove up into the hills, giving
them the high pastures to range. Then from sunrise to sunset he
was alone, except when, early each morning, Grendel and the other
girls came up to carry down the milk to the villages.</p>
<p>All day long the cow-bells sounded in his ears, but still the
time of his wedding was a long way off; it would be five years
before he and Grendel could afford to set up a house and farm,
with cows of their own.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 120]</span>
<p>The great stretch of world that lay out under him, like a
broad map coloured blue and green, made him full of a restless
longing for a move in life. Yonder he could pick out the towns
with their spires and glittering roofs, and the overhead mists,
that gave token of crowded life below. It was there that wealth
could be got; and with wealth men married soon, and were at ease.
Somewhere, he had heard, lived kings and queens, wearing rich
robes and gold crowns on the top of their heart's desire. For
kings and queens, he supposed, loved as did he and Grendel,
regarding nothing else as much in the world besides.</p>
<p>So Killian put heart into his deft hands, and presently had
set to work.</p>
<p>One evening Grendel came up from the valley, after her day's
work, to have a look at her lover; she had brought him some brown
cakes and a bottle of wine. <span class="pagenum">[pg 121]</span>
But Killian, who had caught sight of her eyes over the green rise
at his feet, was hiding something behind his back.</p>
<p>'Whatever have you there?' she asked, as she saw chips, and
tools, and bits of bright foil, lying scattered about the ground.
Yet for three days he would show her nothing, only he said, 'What
I do is because we love each other so.'</p>
<p>At the end of that time, he showed her what he had done. There
she saw a little king and queen, about six inches high; he was in
blue, and she in white; and they were both as dear as they were
small. The king was partly like a cow-herd, having a crown over
his broad-brimmed hat, with thick wooden shoes, and leather-bound
legs; and the queen was like Grendel, with great long plaits past
her waist, and a gold-worked bodice, such as Grendel had for
Sunday wear. 'Aye, aye,' cried Grendel, 'why, it is you and
me!'</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 122]</span>
<p>Then Killian showed her how the joints of the little puppets
moved on delicate wires, and how five strings ran up, one from
each limb, to be fastened to the player's fingers, so that he
might make them act as though life were in them.</p>
<p>'I shall take these down with me to the valley,' said Killian.
'First I shall go about among the villages; then, when I can do
better, I shall go to the towns. After that no doubt the kings
and queens will hear of me, and will send for me to play before
them, and I shall become rich. Then I shall come home and marry
you.'</p>
<p>Grendel thought her lover the most wonderful man in the world,
and it is the truth he was very clever; she kissed him a hundred
times, and the little marionettes also. 'Ah,' she said, 'now we
shall not have to wait five years! in five months you will come
back rich and famous, and we shall marry, and live happily.'</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 123]</span>
<p>How Killian had loved her while making his puppets, only she
knew as well as he. Truly, he had put his heart into them, so
that they were like living beings,&mdash;and so small that their
very smallness made them a marvel. Being a lover, he had put
inside each breast a little heart, and, for the luck of the
thing, had christened them with a drop of his own blood, and a
drop of Grendel's; so each heart had in it one little drop of
blood. Now he was to go out, and try his fortune.</p>
<p>He found a lad to come and take his place and see after the
cows; then he said good-bye to Grendel, and set off on a round of
all the villages of the plain.</p>
<p>At every inn where he put up, he called the country folk
together to the sound of his shepherd's bag-pipes, and showed
them his play. It was only himself and Grendel, no story at all,
merely lovers parting and meeting again, each believing
<span class="pagenum">[pg 124]</span> the other dead, and in the
end living happily to the sound of cow-bells, that showed how
rich they were in herds.</p>
<p>And the villagers laughed and cried, and gave him pence, and a
night's lodging, and food; so that presently he was able to make
himself a little travelling-stage, and hire a piper to play
dance-music for him. But it was always the one story of himself
and Grendel, and no other, though the two puppets wore crowns
upon their heads.</p>

<p>The little marionettes had hearts. That was the beginning of
things: they remembered nothing else. When their eyes had grown
open to the fact, then for them life had begun. After that they
lived like bee and blossom, only that the bee never flew away,
and the honey remained in the blossom.</p>
<p>How this came to pass was a question <span class="pagenum">[pg 125]</span> they never asked; why they loved each other they did
not know. If they had had to think of it they would have said,
'It is because we cannot help it.' And every day one same thing
happened to them that they could not help, the most beautiful
thing in life. It came to them by instinct, taking hold of them
from head to feet and saying, 'love, love, love,' in all sorts of
wonderful ways.</p>
<p>Whenever this thing happened they began to move about softly,
going to and fro, and round and round, dancing, and holding each
other by the hand, putting their cheeks so close together that
their eyelids brushed, and sometimes their little hearts that
heaved. And all the while music from somewhere was giving a
meaning to these things; and over and over again, 'love, love,
love,' was what it kept saying to them.</p>
<p>Their happiness was so great, that they <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 126]</span> would begin playing with it, pretending
that it was all turned into grief. First he would kiss her from
forehead to chin, and into the hollow of her little throat; and
then all down each dear arm, even to the finger-tips; and last of
all her feet; and again last of all her lips, and again last of
all her breast. And then he would go away, walking backwards most
of the time, or if not, still turning round and round to take
another look at her. Then when he was altogether out of sight,
she would sit down and cry, though all the while he would be
peeping at her from his hiding-place, to let her know that he was
not really gone. Then she would lie down, and cry more, and at
last leave off crying and stay almost still on a little bed, that
seemed to come to her from nowhere, just when she was ready to
fall on it. Then, at last, she would shut her eyes, and cover her
face up very slowly with a <span class="pagenum">[pg 127]</span>
sheet, and lie so still that he would grow quite frightened, and
come running from his hiding-place, and lift the sheet, and look
at her; then he would fall down as if his legs had been cut from
under him; then he would get up and throw flowers over her, and
at last catch her up and begin to carry her; and at that she
would wake up all at once and kiss him, to a sound of bells.</p>
<p>They did not know why they did this; it was so beautiful they
could not have thought of it for themselves, and yet it said
everything of life that they wanted to say. For love was the
beginning and the end of it; and always, as they came to the sad
part, they had tender tremblings for fear the other should think
the sorrow was real: he, lest she should think he had really gone
away and left her, never to return; and she, lest he should
believe that she always meant to <span class="pagenum">[pg 128]</span> lie so cruelly still, with a sheet over her eyes. Yet
the kissings that came after made the fearfulness almost the
sweetest thing in their prayer-sayings to each other.</p>
<p>For to them this was a daily prayer, the most solemn thing in
their lives; heart praying to heart, and hand reaching to hand;
and from somewhere overhead gentle monitions as to what they must
do next coming to them, so that they knew how to pray best, now
by lifting a hand, or now by turning the head, or now by running
fast with both feet. And all this beautiful worship of love their
bodies learned to do more perfectly day by day; yet the little
quaking of fear was still in the centre of it all.</p>

<p>Killian's fingers grew nimble; and yet he often wondered to
see how true to life his puppets were, how they sighed, how
<span class="pagenum">[pg 129]</span> they embraced and clung, as
if their hearts were coming in two when the parting drew near.
How lingeringly the little queen drew up the sheet over her face,
when her lover did not return, and let it fall to cover her with
a quiet sigh. Often he cried when she did that part, so like
Grendel was it,&mdash;the tender waiting, and the last giving in!
And then, how the little king shuddered as he drew the cloth from
her face; and how he threw the flowers, as if there were not
enough in the world to express his grief! And yet it was only a
play, made by the twitching of the strings tied to his fingers,
with love as the beginning and end of it.</p>
<p>Killian was getting quite rich in copper coin, so he sent some
of it home to Grendel, that she might buy stock for the home that
was so soon to be theirs. And presently he made bold to go into
the towns, where, instead of copper, he might <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 130]</span> gain silver. He built a bigger stage,
and had more music to go to the dance; but still it was the story
of himself and Grendel, with crowns upon their heads, and nothing
more.</p>
<p>And now, indeed, people began to cry, 'Here is a wonderful new
actor! He has it all at the ends of his fingers! What a pity he
has no better play in which to show himself off!' But Killian
said, 'It is the only play I know how to do.'</p>
<p>Presently there came a sharp fellow to him, who said: 'If you
will go shares with me, I will make your fortune. We have only to
put our heads together, and the thing is done. I will write the
plays for you, and you shall play them on the strings. What is
wanted is a little more real life.'</p>
<p>Killian was a simple fellow, who believed all the world to be
wiser than <span class="pagenum">[pg 131]</span> himself. He was
glad enough to meet with a clever fellow who could write plays
for him. His partner wanted him to make new dresses for the
marionettes, to suit their new parts; but to that Killian would
not agree. So whatever they were they still wore their broad hats
and crowns, and their wooden shoes, that still he might watch in
his own mind himself and Grendel making their way to fortune and
happiness.</p>
<p>The marionettes grew bewildered with their new taking; they
did not understand the meaning of all the coarse things they had
to do. So in the middle of a play, the little queen would fail
now and then in her part, and move awkwardly, wondering what her
lover meant when he sprawled to and fro, and seemed trying to
find in the air more feet than he had upon the ground.</p>
<p>Yet the crowd found her bashful fear <span class="pagenum">[pg 132]</span> so irresistibly funny, that it roared again. Also,
when the little cow-herd with a crown on his head, lifted his
hand or foot toward his partner, and then shrank trembling away,
it roared yet more at the poltroon manner of the thing.</p>
<p>Killian's partner said, 'You alter all my plays, but the way
you do them is something to marvel at. Only, why do you always
bring them round again to that silly lover's ending?'</p>
<p>'I cannot help it,' said Killian; 'often now, with these new
plays, I can't get the strings to work properly. I think the poor
puppets are getting worn out.'</p>
<p>His partner began examining the puppets, and watching how
Killian played them, with more attention; and presently he knew
that there was more in it than met the eye. 'It is the puppets
who are the marvel, not the man,' he said to himself.
<span class="pagenum">[pg 133]</span> 'I could work them better
myself, if I had practice.'</p>
<p>Soon after this he proposed that they should set off for
another town; it was the chief town of all, where they hoped at
last to be allowed to show their plays to the queen herself. 'It
must be a real play this time,' said the partner, 'a tragedy; but
it wants a third person. You must make another puppet, while I
write the play!'</p>
<p>So Killian set to work. But he had no love for the third
puppet, which was neither himself nor Grendel, and he put no
heart inside it, and no little drop of blood. So the new
marionette was but limbs, and a head drawn on wires.</p>
<p>'Soon,' thought Killian, 'I shall be rich enough to go home
and marry Grendel. Then I will throw this stupid third one away;
but the other two we will always keep close to the niche with the
<span class="pagenum">[pg 134]</span> statue of Saint Lady, to
help to make us thankful for the good things God gives us in this
world.'</p>
<p>It was beautiful late spring weather when he and his companion
set out for the capital. On the way Killian's partner told him
the play that would have to be played before the queen, and said,
'In case three should be too much for you to manage, you had
better teach me also to handle the strings.' So Killian began to
teach him, with the two little marionettes alone, the first play
which he had brought down with him from the mountains,&mdash;
that being the easiest of all to learn, and the one he loved best
to teach.</p>
<p>The partner was surprised to find how wonderfully the puppets
followed the leading-strings; in spite of his clumsiness the
story acted itself to perfection.</p>
<p>Simple-hearted Killian was charmed. <span class="pagenum">[pg 135]</span> 'Ah! you clever townsman,' said he, 'see how at first
trial you equal poor me, who have been at it for months! It had
better be you, after all, to do the play when it is called for at
the court.' And this Killian proposed truly out of pure modesty,
but also because he did not like the play his partner had made
for him. 'It is too cruel a one!' he said. 'After they have
played it together so long, I feel as if my two puppets can do
nothing else so well as love each other, and live happily.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but,' said his partner, 'the queen would find that very
dull!' Killian could not see why, but he believed that the
townsman was wiser than himself, and gave in. All he wanted now
was to get money enough to run back home with, and throw himself
into his dear Grendel's arms for life.</p>
<p>So they journeyed on, and at last, one <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 136]</span> day, they came in sight of the capital.
But it had been such a long way to come that when they reached
the gates they found them shut.</p>
<p>The night was warm, and a high moon was overhead. 'Come,' said
Killian, 'and let us lie down in one of these orchards that are
outside the walls!' So they left the high-road, and went and lay
down.</p>
<p>First they ate some food that they carried with them. Then
Killian opened the case in which lay the two marionettes, and
looked them over to see that they were in working order. His
partner took up the odd number, and began practising it; but
Killian's attention all went to the little king cow-herd and his
queen.</p>
<p>He fondled them gently with his hands, and as he looked at
them his heart went up into the mountains to pray for his dear
Grendel.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 137]</span>
<p>Presently he began dreaming to himself like Jacob, only his
dream was just of the simple things of earth. Down the great
green uplands came troops of white cattle; but to him they seemed
to be bridesmaids coming to Grendel's wedding day, and the
ringing of the cow-bells was as sweet to him as the songs of
angels. Before he was fast asleep the two marionettes had slipped
off his knee and lay in the deep grass looking up at the sky.</p>

<p>They had never seen so beautiful a sight before, for never had
they spent a night in the sweet open air till now. Over their
heads swung dusky clusters of blossom, that would look white by
day; and over them the moon went kissing its way from star to
star.</p>
<p>Now and then single blossoms dropped as if they had something
to say to the little cow-herd and his queen, lying there in the
cool grass.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 138]</span>
<p>But the marionettes said nothing; their hearts were very full;
now, at last, they found their old happiness return to them.
Their prayers, that they used to say to each other so tenderly,
had been going wrong for quite a long time; sudden starts and
tremblings of fear had taken hold of their light-hearted
deceptions of each other; and every day things had been going
worse. But now they felt like entering upon a long rest.</p>
<p>As they lay, their hands met together. The little cow-herd
could count her fingers across the palm of his hand, and never
once did she pretend to be drawing them away. How good it all
seemed!</p>
<p>Close by them the odd man was strutting in stiff, ungainly
attitudes, cricking his neck and elbows, and tossing up his toes.
How foolish he seemed to them in their innocent wisdom! They knew
he was nothing to them, for he had <span class="pagenum">[pg 139]</span> no heart; he was nothing but a trick on springs. Yet
they wished he would go away, and give them room to be alone,
while the moon was making a white dream over their lives.</p>

<p>The partner grumbled to himself at the awkward ways of the new
puppet. Instead of obeying, it kicked at the leading strings, and
did everything like a stick, all angles and corners. Presently he
put it back into its box; and then he saw the little king and
queen lying together on the damp grass. He picked them up,
growling at Killian as a simpleton, for leaving them there to get
rusty with the dew. Then he put them also away, and curled
himself up to dream about the success of his play on the
morrow.</p>
<p>Quite early in the morning he and Killian went into the city,
and set up their stage in a corner of the marketplace.
<span class="pagenum">[pg 140]</span> The wonderful acting of the
little king and queen, compared with the ungainly hobblings and
jerkings of the odd man, threw the townspeople into ecstasies of
laughter. They declared they had never seen so funny a sight in
their lives as the beautiful nervous acting of the pair, side by
side with the stiff-jointed awkwardness of the other.</p>
<p>Presently, sure enough, the queen heard tell of this new form
of entertainment, and sent word for the mummers to appear at the
palace.</p>
<p>Killian said to his partner: 'There is something the matter
with the puppets to-day; they want careful handling. I am glad we
settled that you are to do the new play; for, before the queen
and her great ladies, I am likely to lose my head.'</p>
<p>All the court was gathered together to watch the puppet-play,
while behind the <span class="pagenum">[pg 141]</span> scenes the
partner took all the leading strings into his own hands.</p>

<p>The two marionettes opened their eyes, and saw daylight; they
began moving to and fro softly; every now and then they put their
faces together and kissed. The stupid odd man seemed to have
gone; they were so glad to be left alone.</p>
<p>Soon the little king lay down, pretending to be tired, but it
was only that he might put his head in the queen's lap. She bent
over him, and laid her fingers on his eyes, seeming to say, 'Go
to sleep, then! I will shut your eyes for you.' How pretty it was
of her!</p>
<p>Then she covered his face over with her handkerchief; and all
at once in came the odd man, walking on the points of his toes.
The little king, now that the handkerchief was over his face,
opened his eyes, and looked through it, to see <span class=
"pagenum">[pg 142]</span> what his dear queen would be doing now.
The odd man had his arms round her neck, and was kissing her, and
the queen looked as if she were going to kiss him back; but all
at once she had pushed away the odd man so hard that he fell down
with his heels in the air; and then she snatched the handkerchief
from the king's face, and began trembling, and kissing him.</p>
<p>The whole of the court shouted, first with laughter at the odd
man's fall, and then with admiration at the wonderful acting of
the little queen.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes the partner began grumbling to Killian:
'They are going all wrong! It's all your doing, leaving them to
lie in the damp grass last night!'</p>
<p>But still the whole court shouted and applauded. So the play
went on; and now, more and more, the showman had cause to
grumble. Whenever he came to <span class="pagenum">[pg 143]</span> a part where the play required that the queen should
turn from her own cow-herd to the ugly odd man, everything went
wrong. 'Very well,' thought he at last, 'she may be as innocent
as Desdemona but it will all come to the same at the last!'</p>
<p>And so, still more, as the play went on, the little
marionettes trembled and shook with fear. They wished the silly
odd man would go away, and not come interrupting their prayers;
and all the while they loved each other so! No idea of jealousy
ever entered the little king's head; and as for the queen, if the
odd man came and put his arms round her neck and kissed her,
could she help it? All she could do was to run and put her arms
round her own lover when he reappeared; and how the court shouted
and applauded, when she went so quick from one to the other.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 144]</span>
<p>At last the final act was begun; the king came running in with
a sword in his hand, why, he did not know, until he saw his poor
little queen struggling in the arms of the odd man. 'Ah,' thought
he, 'it is to drive him away! Then we shall be by ourselves
again, and happy.'</p>
<p>No one ever fought so wonderfully on a stage before as the
little cow-herd. All the court started to their feet, shouting;
and still, while they shouted, they laughed to see the impossible
odd man scooping about with his sword, and jerking head over
heels, and high up into the air, to get away from the little
king's sword-play. The partner had to keep snatching him up out
of harm's way, for fear of a wrong ending. Then, suddenly he let
him come down with a jump on the little king's head. And at that
the king fell back upon the ground, and felt a sharp pain go
through his heart.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 145]</span>
<p>The odd man drew out his sword and laughed; on the end of it
was a tiny drop of blood. The poor little queen ran up, and bent
down to look in her lover's face, to know if he were really hurt.
And then a terrible thing happened.</p>
<p>Three times the little king raised his sword and pointed it at
her heart, and dropped it again. And all the time the partner was
tugging at the strings, and swearing by all the worst things he
knew.</p>
<p>The little king felt himself growing weak; he was very
frightened. He felt as if he were going away altogether, and
leaving her to think he did not love her any more. And still his
arm went up and down, pointing the sword at her heart.</p>
<p>The showman tugged angrily; then there was the sound of a wire
that snapped&mdash;the king had thrown away his sword.</p>
<p>He reached up his two arms, and laid them fast round the
queen's neck. 'Now <span class="pagenum">[pg 146]</span> at last
she knows that I have not left off loving her.' He felt her
drawing herself away, he held her more and more tightly to his
breast; and now her little face lay close against his. Nothing
should take her away from him now!</p>
<p>The showman pulled violently with all his might, to get her
away; there was a snapping of strings, and then&mdash;the queen
reached out two weak little hands, and laid them under her
lover's head.</p>
<p>They lay quite still, quite still for a long time, and never
moved. 'The play is over!' said the showman, disgusted and angry
at the wreck of his plot.</p>
<p>Suddenly the whole stage became showered with gold; the great
queen and all her court threw out showers of it like rain. It
fell all over the two marionettes, covering them where they lay,
just as the babes in the wood when they died were covered over
with leaves.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 147]</span>
<p>Killian dropped his head on to the boards of the little stage,
and sobbed. The partner let down the curtain, and began gathering
up the gold.</p>
<p>And still, from without, the queen and her court clapped, and
cried their applause; and still within lay Killian with his head
upon the stage, sobbing for the two little marionettes, lying
still with all the springs and strings of their bodies quite
broken. Inside, though he could not see them, their hearts were
broken also. 'Now,' he thought, 'I must go back to Grendel, or I
too shall die!'</p>
<p>That night, in the middle of the night, the partner went away,
carrying with him all the gold that the little marionettes had
earned by their deaths. And these, indeed, he left, seeing that
they were useless any more. But to Killian, when he woke the next
morning, they were the only things left him in the world, to take
back to Grendel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[pg 148]</span>
He took them just as they were, locked in each other's arms,
and went back all the long way to Grendel, up into the hills of
his home, as poor in money as when he first started.</p>
<p>But Grendel saw that he had come back rich; for his face was
grown tender and wise. And for five years they waited very
patiently together, till by cow-keeping he had earned enough for
them to keep some cows of their own, and to live in married
happiness.</p>
<p>The little marionettes they put on a shelf, beneath the cross,
and the statue of our Lady; and there, locked in each other's
arms, those two disciples and martyrs of love lie at peace,
feeling no pain any more in their broken hearts.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
